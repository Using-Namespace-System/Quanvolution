## QuanConvolution Network

In this notebook, we we will be analysing the QuanConvolution Network which is a variant of QHC and includes quantum encoding the MNIST dataset before passing it into a classical network for digit classification. This segment has been abstracted from PennyLane's [official sample](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution.html). The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04767) contains the details of the approach. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30946547/127305957-09540af4-cb26-4756-b600-868961e27c80.png)

The idea behind Quanconvolution Circuits are :

- A small region of the input image, in our example a 2Ã—2 square, is embedded into a quantum circuit. In this demo, this is achieved with parametrized rotations applied to the qubits initialized in the ground state.

- A quantum computation, associated to a unitary U, is performed on the system. The unitary could be generated by a variational quantum circuit or, more simply, by a random circuit.

- The quantum system is finally measured, obtaining a list of classical expectation values. The measurement results could also be classically post-processed as proposed in the paper. But, for simplicity, in this demo we directly use the raw expectation values.

- Analogously to a classical convolution layer, each expectation value is mapped to a different channel of a single output pixel.

- Iterating the same procedure over different regions, one can scan the full input image, producing an output object which will be structured as a multi-channel image.

- The quantum convolution can be followed by further quantum layers or by classical layers.

- The main difference with respect to a classical convolution is that a quantum circuit can generate highly complex kernels whose computation could be, at least in principle, classically intractable.
