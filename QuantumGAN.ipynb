        "This segment has been adapted from this [tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_QGAN.html) on QGAN by Pennylane.This demo constructs a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) [(Lloyd and Weedbrook (2018), Dallaire-Demers and Killoran (2018))](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.98.012324) using two subcircuits, a generator and a discriminator. The generator attempts to generate synthetic quantum data to match a pattern of “real” data, while the discriminator tries to discern real data from fake data (see image below). The gradient of the discriminator’s output provides a training signal for the generator to improve its fake generated data. \n",

The accuracy of the discriminator is given by the probability of the discriminator classifying real data as real - the probability of the discriminator classifying fake data as real, and thus, the cost function will be QNode2 output - QNode1 ouptut.\n",
